Stanza catalog format has been formalized as the <I>Open Publication=20

href=3D"http://opds-spec.org/specs/opds-catalog">http://opds-spec.org/spe=
cs/opds-catalog</A>.=20
Authoritative information about the specification should be taken from =
there.=20
This developer's guide should be considered obsolete.</DIV>
<H3>Welcome to Lexcycle Developer Central</H3>
<P>The Lexcycle Stanza reading platform is a way for an end user to read =
books.=20
It is also a way for content creators and distributors to provide easy =
access to=20
the thousands of Stanza users, as well a means for hardware and software =
vendors=20
to access and extend the book import and export capabilities that Stanza =
Desktop=20
provides.</P>
<P>At this time, we provide the documentation and the facilities for =
enabling=20
content creators and distributors to publish their online books in a =
simple=20
catalog format.</P>
<H3>Who Is The Lexcycle Catalog For?</H3>
<P>Integrating with the Lexcycle Atom Distribution System is targeted at =
anyone=20
who wants to get their content available to the thousands of Stanza =
iPhone/iPod=20
users around the world. While it can be used for the distribution of =
complete=20
free or out-of-copyright works, it is also an attractive option for =
publishers=20
who would like to provide previews or sample chapters of their books to =
users as=20
a means of promoting their commercial publications. Any kind of textual =
content=20
can utilize the Lexcycle Atom Distribution System; books, magazines, =
newspapers,=20
essays, blogs, poetry, and religious texts are all prime candidates for=20
distribution via this mechanism.</P>
<H3>The Lexcycle Stanza Catalog Format</H3>
<P>Users of Stanza for the iPhone or iPod Touch, in addition to being =
able to=20
access their books from Stanza Desktop, are also able to access the =
online=20
Lexcycle Catalog. Currently, the catalog offers a number of free titles, =
some=20
hosted by lexcycle.com, and others offered by partner sites such as=20
feedbooks.com, bookglutton.com, and smashwords.com. This feature might =
best be=20
understood by viewing the demonstration movie at <A=20
href=3D"http://www.lexcycle.com/">http://www.lexcycle.com/</A></P>
<P>The mechanism through which Stanza accesses the distributed catalog =
has three=20
components: content in the ePub/Open eBook format or the eReader format, =
XML=20
catalog metadata, and an HTTP transport for the catalog. Expertise in =
these=20
areas is not a requirement for implementing your own catalog, but some=20
familiarity is recommended. The remainder of this document will discuss =
each of=20
those components in turn.</P>
<H3>The Book Format: Open eBook/ePub</H3>
<P>ePub, also known as Open eBook, is the only standardized electronic =
book=20
format available. It is flexible, enjoys high compression, and utilizes=20
standardized technologies (XHTML, CSS, Dublin Core, and ZIP) that are =
familiar=20
to many developers. Since ePub is a relatively new standard, most =
existing=20
titles are in other =E2=80=94 often proprietary =E2=80=94 formats such =
as Mobipocket, Microsoft=20
LIT, Sony LRF, or Amazon Kindle. However, Open eBook format is making =
gains and=20
already has support in such products as Stanza, <A=20
href=3D"http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">Adobe Digital=20
Editions</A>, <A href=3D"http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/">Calibre</A>, <A =

href=3D"http://www.fbreader.org/">FBReader</A>, Openberg Lector, and=20
Mobipocket.</P>
<P>The Open eBook standard is created and managed by the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.idpf.org/">International Digital Publishing Forum =
(IDPF)</A>.=20
Their site should be your primary reference for creating and managing =
your books=20
in the Open eBook format; they freely publish detailed specifications on =
every=20
step of the eBook format.</P>
<P>While it is possible to create a compliant ePub file using merely a =
text=20
editor and a program to make zip files, and while creating a small book =
that way=20
may be useful as a learning exercise, large-scale content creation would =
be=20
tedious and error prone. (For those interested in trying, a tutorial is=20
available at <A=20
href=3D"http://www.jedisaber.com/eBooks/tutorial.asp">http://www.jedisabe=
r.com/eBooks/tutorial.asp</A>.)=20
There are a number of tools that can help with the creation of ePub =
files. First=20
off is <A href=3D"http://stanza.lexcycle.com/">Stanza Desktop</A>: while =
Stanza=20
iPhone/iPod only supports ePub files, Stanza Desktop is able to read =
books in a=20
number of formats (such as Mobipocket, MS Word, PDF, HTML, Plain text, =
RTF,=20
Fictionbook, and many others) and can export them to fully-compliant =
Open eBook=20
files. Although this is a good solution if you are interested in the =
quick (and,=20
while Stanza is still in beta, free) conversion of your content to Open =
eBook,=20
it does present some limitations, since Stanza Desktop is primarily a=20
<EM>reading</EM> platform, not a full transcoding platform. As such, =
many=20
elements of a book, such as formatting, tables, and images, are lost =
when Stanza=20
opens and converts the book content to Open eBook. These limitations can =
be=20
unacceptable to some book publishers and distributors.</P>
<P>If you already have your books in HTML format, you can also try using =
the=20
online book conversion tool at <A=20
href=3D"http://www.bookglutton.com/api">http://www.bookglutton.com/api</A=
> to=20
convert your files to ePub.</P>
<P>For publishers and distributors who want more sophisticated control =
over the=20
generation of ePub files than Stanza Desktop can provide, <A=20
href=3D"http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/">Adobe InDesign</A> is =
able to=20
generate ePub content directly. InDesign is not cheap, but they do have =
a free=20
trial available. Instructions for using InDesign to create ePub files =
can be=20
found at <A=20
href=3D"http://blogs.adobe.com/digitaleditions/indesign-epub.html">http:/=
/blogs.adobe.com/digitaleditions/indesign-epub.html</A>.</P>
<P>Finally, for the XML-oriented developer, docbook files can be =
transformed=20
into compliant ePub files using a recent release of the docbook XSL =
style=20
sheets. (Read about it <A=20
href=3D"http://blogs.adobe.com/digitaleditions/2008/06/docbook_xsl_epub_t=
arget_is_rea.html">here</A>.)=20
Docbook is a widely-used XML format to express the complete contents of =
a book.=20
Contrary to what the name suggests, it is not limited to just =
documentation, but=20
can support any book contents. This options is attractive to developers =
who=20
might already have their content in some other XML format (such as =
Fictionbook=20
files); an experienced developer can assemble a toolchain to transform =
their=20
content into docbook and then use the standard style sheets to generate =
the=20
resulting ePub, in a completely automated way.</P>
<P>Once you have created or converted your book into the ePub format =
through=20
whichever mechanism you like, you must ensure that the file is fully =
compliant=20
with the ePub standard. Stanza will not open the ePub file unless it is =
100%=20
compliant with the standard. Fortunately, there is a very useful free =
tool=20
available to validate that your generated content complies with the ePub =

standard: <A=20
href=3D"http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/">http://code.google.com/p/epu=
bcheck/</A>.</P>
<H3>The Catalog Format: XML</H3>
<P>So you've transformed your thousands of free books into 100% =
compliant Open=20
eBook ePub files, and now you want to create your own catalog that =
Stanza will=20
access to read your books. Stanza uses the standard Atom protocol for =
catalogs.=20
A good description of Atom can be found at <A=20
href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Wikipedia</A>, and =
the full=20
specification is described in <A =
href=3D"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">RFC=20
4287 =E2=80=93 "The Atom Syndication Format"</A>.</P>
<P>The catalog is defined as a series of links. The only two mime types =
that=20
Stanza supports are "application/atom+xml" (which specified that the =
link goes=20
to another catalog file, which allows for the creation of hierarchical=20
catalogs), and "application/epub+zip", which specifies that the link =
points to a=20
valid ePub book. When composing Atom files by hand, it is strongly =
recommended=20
that you utilize a validator to ensure that the file will be compatible =
with=20
Stanza, such as the one at <A=20
href=3D"http://validator.w3.org/feed">http://validator.w3.org/feed</A>.</=

</PRE></CODE>
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: For large and complex catalogs, you may be =
interested=20
in dynamically generating the catalog XML files. Stanza makes no =
distinction=20
between catalogs that are kept statically or dynamically.</P>
<H3>Other catalog features</H3>
<P>The Stanza catalog format also had the following additional features: =
</P>
<H4>Searching</H4>
<P>If you have a link with the rel <CODE>search</CODE> in the header of =
any Atom=20
XML file, Stanza will show a magnifying glass icon in the upper-right =
corner of=20
the catalog interface. The user will then be able to enter search terms =
into the=20
search box that pops up, and it will be sent to the server by replacing =
the=20
instance of the string "{searchTerms}" in the link's <CODE>href</CODE>=20
attribute. </P>
<P>For example, if you have the following link: <CODE><PRE>&lt;link =
rel=3D"search" title=3D"Search Catalog" type=3D"application/atom+xml" =
href=3D"http://www.billybobsbooks.com/search.php?q=3D{searchTerms}"/&gt;<=
/PRE></CODE>And=20
if the user enters "The Great Gatsby" into the search field and submits, =
then=20
Stanza will fetch the next catalog by going to the URL=20
"http://www.billybobsbooks.com/search.php?q=3DThe+Great+Gatsby".=20
<P></P>
<P>Stanza does not put any requirements on the search terms you enter or =
the=20
meaning of the search. For example, if your top-level catalog has an =
"Authors"=20
sub-catalog, you could have the search URL that comes up in that catalog =

prioritize author names. Alternatively, you could have all your search =
URLs=20
always go to a single global search URL (which is the decision that most =

catalogs choose). </P>
<H4>Embedded Browser</H4>
<P>Stanza handles links of type <CODE>application/atom+xml</CODE> by =
loading the=20
results as another catalog entry, and handles links of type=20
<CODE>application/epub+zip</CODE> and <CODE>application/ereader</CODE> =
by=20
loading the URL and trying to import it as a book. Additionally, you can =
have=20
links of type <CODE>application/xhtml+xml</CODE> and =
<CODE>text/html</CODE> from=20
your catalog entry, which will cause Stanza to push an embedded web =
browser as=20
the next view. The embedded browser uses the same rendering engine =
("WebKit") as=20
Safari does, and in general it behaves similarly to Safari. It does not =
have all=20
the features of a full browser (specifically, it lacks bookmarks, the =
ability to=20
open links in a new window, history searching, or the ability to enter =
an=20
arbitrary URL), but it is sufficient to perform most browsing =
activities. The=20
embedded browser also has one feature that Safari on the iPhone lacks: =
it is=20
able to download ePub and eReader books directly from a web page. So if =
you have=20
a storefront where people can download books, and the user loads that =
web page=20
from within Stanza's embedded browser, the user will be able to download =
those=20
books directly into Stanza. </P>
<P>One way in which the embedded browser is frequently used is as a =
mechanism=20
for the user to register an account with a bookstore, or to perform the =
purchase=20
transaction (as Stanza does not yet have any built-in transaction =
processing=20
abilities). A book store's catalog may allow users to browse and search =
for=20
books using the familiar and efficient Stanza catalog Atom XML =
interface, but=20
then when they want to purchase and download the book, they might enter =
the=20
embedded browser to log in and complete the transaction. Another way in =
which=20
the embedded browser feature is used is to provide links to other sites =
that=20
might have additional useful information like book reviews. </P>
<H4>Catalog Description Page</H4>
<P>It is generally recommended that the first entry in your top-level of =
a=20
catalog has an "About" link to an XHTML page describing the catalog, its =

contents, and contact information for the catalog maintainer. This can =
be=20
accomplished by having a normal entry that links to an XHTML page with =
that=20
information. E.g.: <CODE><PRE>&lt;entry&gt;
&lt;title&gt;About this Catalog&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link type=3D"text/html" href=3D"about.xhtml"&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;content type=3D"text"&gt;About Billy Bob's Books&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;entry&gt;
</PRE></CODE>It is recommended that the resulting XHTML page be as =
simple as=20
possible, and try to conform to the UI guidelines of the mobile =
Operating System=20
that is is implemented on. To this end, Lexcycle has a style sheet that =
we=20
recommend you use in your implementation of any informational pages; =
this style=20
sheet will be updated over time to reflect the UI of the particular =
Operating=20
System that is used to access it. Using this style sheet, your=20
<CODE>about.xhtml</CODE> page might look like: <CODE><PRE>&lt;!DOCTYPE =
html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" =
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=3D"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta name=3D"viewport" content=3D"initial-scale=3D1.0, =
user-scalable=3Dno" /&gt;
&lt;meta name=3D"stanza-toolbars" content=3D"hide" /&gt;
&lt;link href=3D"http://images.lexcycle.com/mobiletext.css" =
rel=3D"stylesheet" type=3D"text/css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id=3D"title"&gt;Information about Billy Bob's Book&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=3D"description"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to Billy Bob's Books! We aim to be your one-stop shop for all =
books related to fans of Billy Bob!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to suggest books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have any books you would like to suggest for this catalog, please =
contact
Billy Bob himself at &lt;a =
href=3D"mailto:billybob@billybobsbooks.com"&gt;billybob@billybobsbooks.co=
m&lt;/a&gt; ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</PRE></CODE>
<P></P>
<H4>Authentication</H4>
<P>Stanza's catalog supports basic HTTP authentication, which you can =
use to=20
provide catalog information specific to the user. If a "401 =
Unauthorized" code=20
is sent back for any requests, then Stanza will pop-up a =
username/password=20
dialog which enabled the user to enter a username and password. This =
information=20
is useful if, say, your catalog has a "bookshelf" feature that can list =
all the=20
books that a user has purchased. </P>
<H4>Links in Book Descriptions</H4>
<P>A book description can contain one or more <CODE>link</CODE> =
elements, which=20
will be displayed beneath the book's description in the catalog. The=20
<CODE>rel</CODE> for these links is not currently used, but the links to =
need to=20
be of a supported <CODE>type</CODE>. I.e., they need to be one of:=20
<UL>
  <LI><CODE>application/atom+xml</CODE>: traverses to the specified =
catalog</LI>
  <LI><CODE>application/epub+zip</CODE>: downloads the specified link =
and=20
  imports the book</LI>
  <LI><CODE>application/ereader</CODE>: downloads the specified link and =
imports=20
  the book</LI>
  <LI><CODE>application/xhtml+xml</CODE>: launches the embedded browser =
with the=20
  URL</LI>
  <LI><CODE>text/html</CODE>: launches the embedded browser with the =
URL</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>Having links in the book description is essential for providing the =
ability=20
for the user to perform additional actions for the book. For example, =
the book=20
may have an <CODE>application/xhtml+xml</CODE> link that goes to a web =
page that=20
contains book reviews, an <CODE>application/atom+xml</CODE> that links =
to a=20
"People Also Purchases..." catalog of similar books, and a=20
<CODE>application/epub+zip</CODE> link that allows the user to download =
a free=20
sample of the book. </P>
<H4>Results Pagination</H4>
<P>Since users may be on slow cellular networks when accessing your =
catalog, you=20
should avoid sending very large batches of responses to any requests. In =

general, we recommend paginating results in batches of 20 or 30. If a =
catalog=20
has a <CODE>link</CODE> with <CODE>rel=3D'next'</CODE>, then that will =
cause=20
Stanza to display a "Load More Results..." button at the bottom of the =
catalog.=20
When clicked, the URL in the link will be hit, and additional results =
will be=20
loaded and appended to the current catalog list. </P>
<H4>Catalog Subdescriptions</H4>
<P>Sub-catalogs can have a small piece of descriptive text that appears =
below=20
the catalog name. This is useful for summarizing the catalog contents or =

providing additional hints. This is accomplished by using code like: =
<CODE><PRE>&lt;entry&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Andersen, Hans Christian&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link type=3D"application/atom+xml" =
href=3D"http://www.billybobsbooks.com/anderson.atom"&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;content type=3D"text"&gt;11 books by this author&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</PRE></CODE><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Stanza currently requires that the=20
<CODE>content</CODE> element be the very last element in the =
<CODE>entry</CODE>.=20

<P></P>
<H4>Compression</H4>
<P>Stanza supports gzip compression for all catalog interactions. It is =
highly=20
recommended that you enable this feature on your web server, as it can=20
dramatically speed up catalog access, especially for people using Stanza =
over=20
slow cellular networks. </P>
<H4>Icons</H4>
<P>Catalog developers are encourages to use icons for book descriptions =
as well=20
as catalog and sub-catalog entries. Links will a rel of=20
<CODE>x-stanza-cover-image-thumbnail</CODE> will be displayed in the =
catalog=20
list, and links with a rel of <CODE>x-stanza-cover-image</CODE> will =
show up as=20
the cover image when the user taps on the book's listing to get its =
description.=20
The thumbnail image for a book should have a maximum width &amp; height =
of 125=20
pixels. There are no restrictions on the aspect ratio of the image, but =
in=20
general it is recommended that you try to be consistent in the aspect =
ratio for=20
your books. We generally recommend an aspect ratio of 2:3 =
(width:height). If a=20
thumbnail image has a width or height greater than 125 pixels, Stanza =
will scale=20
it down and preserve the aspect ratio. However, since users may open a =
large=20
list of books, it is essential you make efficient use of bandwidth by =
keeping=20
the size of the images as small as possible. </P>
<P>In addition to thumbnail and full sized cover images, Stanza also =
supports=20
images attached to sub-catalogs. This, in combination with using catalog =

sub-descriptions, can provide a useful hint to the user about the =
meaning of a=20
particular catalog entry. As with cover images, there are no =
restrictions on the=20
particular size of a catalog icon, but care should be taken to keep the =
image=20
size as small as possible, and to keep the size consistent across all =
entries in=20
the catalog. </P>
<P>When the <CODE>href</CODE> attribute of an image or icon is a URL, =
Stanza=20
will asynchronously fetch that URL whenever the book is displayed. This =
makes=20
efficient use of bandwidth, since if a user brings up a catalog page =
with 25=20
books, only the first books that are displayed will have their covers=20
automatically fetched. As the user scrolls down the list, the covers =
will=20
dynamically be fetched for those books (provided they are not already =
cached).=20
In some cases, however, it might make more sense to pre-load the image =
by=20
embedded it directly into the catalog page. This might be used for, say, =
the=20
top-level view of the catalog where you will always have the same icons =
for the=20
page. In these cases, you can instead use a URL of the form=20
"data:image/png;base64,..." to embed the Base-64 encoded image data =
directly=20
into the XML, thereby removing the need for Stanza to asynchronously =
request the=20
image. A good description of the Data URL scheme, as well as links to =
tools that=20
can generate a data: URI for your images, can be found at <A=20
href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">Wikipedia</A>. =
</P>
<H3>The Catalog Transport: HTTP</H3>
<P>The last step of making your content available online is hosting it. =
Stanza=20
accesses catalogs via standard HTTP; that is, you need to host your =
catalogs and=20
books on a web server. Setting up a web server or hosting options is =
well beyond=20
the scope of this documentation, but in short, if you are able to create =
and=20
upload a web page so it is available on the internet, you are able to =
create a=20
public catalog that Stanza can use. There are a wide variety of Atom =
publishing=20
tools available, most of which we expect to be compatible with Stanza. =
You may=20
wish to investigate using some of these tools to create catalogs.</P>
<H3>Testing your catalog</H3>
<P>Once you have created your books, generated or written your catalog =
files,=20
and set them all up on a host somewhere, you can now test your catalog! =
In=20
Stanza 1.5, you can add a new catalog by going to the "Online Catalog" =
section=20
and tapping the "+" button, where you can enter the name and URL of you =
catalog=20
to add.</P>
<H3>The Final Steps</H3>
<P>You can use a link formatted with the "stanzacatalog://" protocol, =
which,=20
when accessed on an iPhone or iPod that already has Stanza 1.5 or higher =

installed, will launch Stanza and add the linked catalog as a new custom =

catalog. For example, if your catalog located at=20
"http://www.billybobsbooks.com/catalog.atom", accessing a link of the =
format=20
"stanzacatalog://www.billybobsbooks.com/catalog.atom" will result in =
that=20
catalog being added to your Stanza catalog.</P>
<P>Lexcycle also provides the ability for some catalogs to be listed in =
Stanza's=20
default Online Catalog section. Please contact <A=20
href=3D"mailto:catalog@lexcycle.com">catalog@lexcycle.com</A> for =
further=20
details.</P>
<H3>Catalog Checklist</H3>
<P>Here are some final checklists for ensuring that your catalog =
provides a good=20
user experience:=20
<OL>
  <LI>Does your catalog's Atom XML pass the validator at <A=20
  =
href=3D"http://validator.w3.org/feed">http://validator.w3.org/feed</A>? =
If not,=20
  then people will probably encounter problems with your catalog.</LI>
  <LI>If your catalog is a "large" catalog (i.e., more than 100 books), =
do you=20
  provide a "search" feature?</LI>
  <LI>If your catalog is large, do you sub-divide the catalog into =
logical=20
  sections (such as books by author, genre, title, etc.)?</LI>
  <LI>When your catalog displays a large number of books, do you =
paginate the=20
  results?</LI>
  <LI>Do you have an "About" page describing the catalog at the top of =
the first=20
  catalog page the user sees?</LI>
  <LI>Do you include cover art (both thumbnails and large versions) for =
your=20
  books? Users <I>love</I> cover art.</LI>
  <LI>Do your book entries include comprehensive descriptions of the=20
books?</LI></OL>
