                    RELEASE NOTES for Calibre2Opds v3.6
                    -----------------------------------

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Online documentation for Calibre2Opds can now be found at:
  http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Calibre2Opds_Index
There is a link to this from the main Calibre2Opds GUI via the Help
button.  It is also included in the Calibre2Opds catalogs at the top
level.  User are encouraged to pass back suggestions for enhancments
to reflect their experience of using Calibre2Opds. Since the documentation
is organised as a wiki, users can also contribute their own input to
improve the documentation.

The #number type references in these notes refer to the bug number
entries for calibre2opds in the calibre2opds Issue register that is at:

Localizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Calibre2Opds application is designed to make it easy to be
localized to languages other than English.  However to do so, input
is required from those who can speak those languages to provide the
correct localization text.  This is not a task that requires
programming skills, so users are encouraged to contribute their
expertise in this area.  The details on how to go about this can be
found at:
