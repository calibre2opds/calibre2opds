Generate OPDS and HTML catalogs from your Calibre ebooks database

This tool can read the Calibre database, and extract from it the information needed to generate OPDS
and HTML catalogs (typically as a sub-folder inside the Calibre library folder).

If this folder is published to a web server, or shared using a syncing service, then
OPDS-compatible programs (for example Marvin or MegaReader on an iPhone, or Aldiko on Android) can access these
catalogs, and use them to automatically display your Calibre library in nicely sorted categories.
The program is also capable of generating an HTML version of the catalog for access via any standard browser.
