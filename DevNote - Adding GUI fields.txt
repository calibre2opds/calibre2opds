                      DevNote - Adding GUI Fields
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a note on the process involved in adding new fields to the calibre2opds GUI.
The process is s bit tricky, so this is intended to act both as a guide to someone not familiar
with the source and also as a checklist/reminder of the steps involved.

You will need the NetBeans IDE installed (from www.netbeans.org) as the Form editor from that tool is used.

Editing the Form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Load the IDE and select the Open File option

-  Navigate to the form to be edited.  The one you are most likely to want to edit is the main GUI
    which is found at OpdsOutput\src\main\java\com\gmail\dpierron\calibre\gui\Mainframe.form
    There is an associated Mainframe.java file but the loading of this is handled automatically.

- The main body of the form is uses a gridbox layout 4 columns wide (used as 2 pairs of 2).
  The first column is used to hold the label which is right (East) aligned.
  The second column holds the input field which is left (West) aligned.

-  Add a field of the requisite type from the toolbox
   Set the following properties:
   Text:  whatever you like - recommended you use the field variable name as it will then be obvious
          if you have applied the localization text
   X-Position
   y-position

-  If it is a label field then set the onMouseClick event to ??? so that you can get the tooltip to be shown


Localization
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All fields to be used in the GUI should have a localization entry in the localization.xls spreadsheet
- If the field is one for setting a setting then there will normally be two entries set up.  One will end
  in .label and is the text to be shown in the GUI.   The other will end in .tooltip and is the
  tooltip text that can also be shown by clicking on the label field.
- Export button on the spreadsheet should be used to ensure that the language specific .properties files
  are updated with the latest text strings.

Java changes to support GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The following changes need to be made in the .java file corresponding to the .form file
  This will typically be Mainframe.java
  There is a table at the strt of mainframe.java of type GuiField that defines entries for each
  GUI field to handle:
  - Localisation of labels andtooltips
  - Method names to be used for loading/storing configuration items

Note that it may often be easier to do the work to get a new option added to the
configuration options before doing the GUI related Java work

Java changes to support new configuration option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is likely that the reason the GUI is being edited is to support a new configuration option.
The following specifies the steps needed to get the option added
- DefaultConfigurationSettins.java
                              Add entry for field and give its default value
- ConfigurationHolder.java:   Add an entry for the constant name in the configuration properties file
                              Add appropriate get/set routines
- GetConfigurationInterface.java
                              Add get routine to those defined for this interface
- SetConfigurationInterface.java
                              Add set routine to those defined for this interface
- DefaultConfigurationSettings.java
                              Add get method to return default value for property
