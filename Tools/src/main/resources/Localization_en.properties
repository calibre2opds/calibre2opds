config.IncludeCoversInCatalog.label=Include cover images within the catalog
config.IncludeCoversInCatalog.tooltip=<html>Include the cover images in the catalog rather than use ones stored with the books in the Calibre Library.<br><br>If using this option you are quite likely to want to make sure the option to generate optimised cover<br>and thumbnail images have not been suppressed to keep total size down.<br><br><b>CAUTION</b>:<br>Including cover images in the catalog will mean it uses <b>a lot more space</b> so it is not advisable to<br>use this option if the catalog is held on cloud storage.  You can minimise the cost by setting<br>the option to use thumbnails for cover images.
config.UseThumbnailsAsCovers.label=Use thumbnails for cover images
config.UseThumbnailsAsCovers.tooltip=<html>Normally one uses separate images for covers and thumbnails and book cover images<br>as you want higher quality images to be used for covers.<br><br>If you set this option then the thumbnail images (which are smaller but of lower quality)<br> will also be used for cover images.  The cover images will still be displayed at the size<br>you have set, but they may appear a bit fuzzy due to the loss of quality.<br><br>This option is of particular use when you have selected the option to include cover<br>images in the catalog as it helps keep the catalog size down.
config.ZipCatalog.label=Create Zip of catalog
config.ZipCatalog.tooltip=<html>Create a ZIP file for the files that make up the catalog.<br><br>This is typically used to create a copy of the catalog as a 'web site'<br>suitable for offline viewing, so you are likely to also want to set the <br>option to omit xml files from the ZIP to both <br>reduce the number of files and the size of the ZIP.
config.ZipOmitXml.label=Omit XML files from ZIP of catalog
config.ZipOmitXml.tooltip=<html>Omit any .xml files when creating a ZIP of the catalog.<br><br>Used if you only want the files that are relevant to an HTML catalog<br>as is likely to be the case if you are trying to create a psuedo 'web site'<br>that can be used for offline viewing of the catalog.<br><br>It will also reduce the size of the ZIP and the number of files contained<br>in the ZIP.
config.ExternalIcons.label=Use external Icon files
config.ExternalIcons.tooltip=<html>Instead of embedding the icons for the top levels of the catalogs use external files instead.<br><br>This results in slower page loading, but is needed for readers with browsers (such as the Kindle)<br>that cannot handle the icons embedded as binary images.<br><br>It is also recommended that you set this option if using cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox)<br>for the catalog as it will minimise space used for the catalog.<br><br>If this option is cleared then image files are embedded within the catalog xml/html files.
config.ExternalImages.label=Use external Image files
config.ExternalImages.tooltip=<html>Normally one uses external image files for the covers and thumbnails. <br><br>Typically these will be the images that are held in the Calibre library with each book.<br><br>If this option is cleared, then instead of providing references to external image files, <br>the images are stored as binary encoded data within the xml/html files.<br>This makes these files larger but avoids the need to reference these external image files at runtime.<br><br>This feature is most likely to be of use when you have selected the option to include images within the catalog.<br>Setting this option cuts down the number of files in this case as separate image files are no longer<br>required although it will increase slightly the space occupied by such a catalog.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b><br>Some browsers (such as the Kindle browser) cannot handle embedded images.


config.ThumbnailGenerate.label=Do not generate thumbnails
config.ThumbnailGenerate.tooltip=<html>Do not generate thumbnail images.<br><br>This means that loading catalog pages is slightly slower<br>but you save on file space in the catalog.<br><br>It is a good idea to set this option if using cloud storage (e.g.) for your calibre library<br>as it reduces the size of the generated catalog.

config.ThumbnailHeight.label=Thumbnail height
config.ThumbnailHeight.tooltip=<html>Sets the height for displaying thumbnail images in the calibre2opds generated catalog.<br>If generation of thumbnails is not suppressed then thumbnail image files optimized<br>for this resolution will be generated from the calibre cover images.

config.CoverResize.label=Do not generate resized covers
config.CoverResize.tooltip=<html>Use the cover images already stored in the calibre library without resizing them to a standard size.<br><br>This can result in less space used for the catalog but slower catalog page loading.<br><br>It is a good idea to set this option if using cloud storage (e.g.) for your calibre library<br>as it reduces the size of the generated catalog.

config.CoverHeight.label=Cover height
config.CoverHeight.tooltip=<html>Sets the height for displaying cover images in the calibre2opds generated catalog.<br>If generation of cover images is not suppressed then cover images optimized<br>for this resolution will be generated from the Calibre cover images.

config.SplitTagsOn.label=Split tags using
config.SplitTagsOn.tooltip=<html>Specifies a character that will be used to split indivudal tags into a tag list in a tree<br>(e.g. '':'' if your tags are named like Action:ToRead:Asap)
config.SplitTagsOnComma.warn=<html>Are you sure that you want to use comma as the split character(s) to split an individual tag into sub-tags.<br><br>Calibre has the default use of comma hard-coded as the way to split a list of tags into separate<br>tags, so no individual tag can contain the comma character (unless the whole tag is surrounded by quotes)..<br><br>If you are trying to set the the comma character, then it is likely that uoy have misundertood<br>the use of this option within Calibre2opds and should simply disable spltting tags.
config.SplitTagsOnEmpty.error=<html>You have specified that you want to split tags into sub-tags, but have not specified<br>which character(s) should be use to identify the split points.
config.DontSplitTagsOn.label=Disable splitting tags
config.DontSplitTagsOn.tooltip=<html>Disable splitting tags even if you have set the 'Split tags on' option.<br><br>Provides an easy way to toggle the split on/off without having to clear the split chanrcter.

config.IncludeBooksWithNoFile.label=Include books without file
config.IncludeBooksWithNoFile.tooltip=<html>Include books without any file.<br><br>If not set then only books with a format that is on the list specified<br>\by "Include formats" will be listed in the generated catalog.

config.CryptFilenames.label=Encrypt the filenames
config.CryptFilenames.tooltip=<html>If set, the filenames will be encrypted in such a way that it is impossible to guess them,<br>yet from one run to the next they stay constant<br><br>It is recommended that you set this option if your catalog is going to be made visible<br>on the public internet and you have no explicit security mechanism's in place to protect<br>it from access by unauthorised users.

config.GenerateExternalLinks.label=Do not generate external links
config.GenerateExternalLinks.tooltip=<html>If set, the books entries will not contain links to external sites (e.g. Wikipedia, Goodreads…)<br><br>Setting this disables all the links that can be set on the Book reference links tab<br>and is easier than disabling each of them explicitly on that tab.

config.GenerateCrossLinks.label=Do not generate cross-reference links
config.GenerateCrossLinks.tooltip=<html>If set, the books entries will not contain cross-reference links to other sub-catalog types.

config.TagsToMakeDeep.label=Tags that will get an additional level
config.TagsToMakeDeep.tooltip=<html>If set, the catalogs of these tags will get an additional level<br>sub-dividing them into authors, series, tags, ...<br><br><b>WARNING: </b><br>adding tags here will make the generation process slower and increase<br>the size of the generated catalog.
